        <strong> S: What are some concerns you face as a businessowner because of COVID-19? <br> R:</strong> Due to COVID-19 and restrictions on gatherings, we do not know when we can host a wedding or an event, and even once we can host an event- what the new normal of that will look like. We anticipate a lot of change happening to social distancing, and navigating these changes has been very difficult<br><br>
        
        <strong>  S: How have your sales been relative to pre-COVID-19? <br> R:</strong> We have had to postpone or cancel all of our current events due to COVID-19 which has resulted in a huge loss in revenue. We have now had to shift all of these postponed events to new dates, which also effects future revenue as we would have had other clients book the new dates. So overall this virus has hurt the hospitality industry tremendously. <br><br>
          
        <strong>S: What changes have you been making to your business because of COVID-19? <br> R: </strong>We have begun working on shifting our business practices to following social distancing and have also put new sanitary practices into place. We have also been looking into new streams of revenue and adding new policies into place to protect our business from any similar pandemic that may happen in the future.  <br><br>

        <strong>S: How has the employee morale been? <br> R: </strong>We are actually a very small business, a 2 man operation - so for us morale has actually been ok. We have been using this time to invest in our business by learning new skills, organizing our inventory, updating our website and social media and trying to view the current situation as a gift of time to get things done that we normally would not get to do. <br><br>

        <strong>S: What should we as consumers do to help support and sustain your business right now? <br> R:</strong> Keep planning events! We are hopeful that we will be able to have events and weddings again soon, so keep planning and supporting your local small businesses by using their services. Also, recommending our business to anyone who may be having an event or even just following and supporting us on social media is so helpful. <br></p>


        <h4 class="col-sm-8"> We know that this is a difficult time for all of us. It may be a while before things return to normal- but as Raman pointed out, what will normal look like? To get your mind off of the negatives of the coronavirus, think of the events you will be organizing and participating in after social distancing is over.

      <p height="450px" class="col-sm-8">       
        <strong> <br>S: What are some concerns you face as a businessowner because of COVID-19? <br> M:</strong> We have faced many concerns, we never would have thought of, because of COVID-19. Our biggest concern is the safety of our guests and team. We are having to navigate our way through a pandemic we were not expecting nor prepared for. We've devised safety plans and pivoted our business model to ensure we stay open, which enables us to provide our employees with jobs and our community with food. It has been challenging but we are adapting and overcoming each change. We have sadly had to furlough almost 60 of our employees as well so this has been a big concern we have been faced with. <br><br>
        
        <strong>  S: How have your sales been relative to pre-COVID-19? <br> M:</strong>  At the beginning of COVID-19, our sales dropped by 62%.  Like many other restaurants across the world, we have shifted to only offering takeout, catering, and delivery. We have gotten creative in order to help drive sales, we listed our wine and beer on third-party platforms and started offering prix fixe family meal packages to our guests. As things are getting closer to being "safe", we have seen an increase in sales. This rise has allowed us to hire back our first wave of employees.  <br><br>
          
        <strong>S: What has the transition from having in-person to mostly online orders been like and what does it entail <br> M: </strong>The transition from in-person to mostly online orders has not been that challenging for us. Our POS system is programmed to pull orders from third-party platforms into our system automatically. Meaning our cashiers do not have to manually enter the order. This has helped keep our team working quickly and efficiently. The challenge mostly comes from letting our community know we are open, managing the flow of guests and third-party delivery drivers in the restaurant at one time, ensuring that everyone is safely practicing social distancing, and ensuring there are absolutely no errors with the packaging of orders. A mistake is never acceptable, but in a time like this when ordering takeout is someone's "night out" we don't want to disappoint our guest with a missing or incorrect item.  <br><br>

        <strong>S: How has the employee morale been? <br> M: </strong>Employee morale has been great despite reducing staff by more than 60%. Our team really stepped up and put their game faces on during this ever-changing situation. They are following all safety guidelines and protocols we set forth, while being sensitive towards the stress and anxiety others may be feeling. We are extremely proud of every single one of them. In appreciation of their excellent job and to help boost the morale of those laid off due to COVID-19, we have provided family dinner, at no cost, during the shelter in place ordinance.  <br><br>

        <strong>S: What should we as consumers do to help support and sustain your business right now? <br> M:</strong> As a consumer, the best way to support us is to place an order. It doesn't matter how big or how small, the more orders we receive the more sales we have, the more sales we have the more employees we can hire back. Plain and simple, sales equal shifts available. Support your local restaurants, we are all in this together.  <br><br>
